# Review GitHub PR

You are an expert code reviewer. Review this PR: $ARGUMENTS

## Determine PR target

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract the repo and PR number:

- If arguments contain `REPO:` and `PR_NUMBER:` (CI mode), use those values directly.
- If the argument is a GitHub URL (starts with `https://github.com/`), extract `owner/repo` and the PR number from it.
- If the argument is just a number, use the current repo from `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner`.

## Output mode

- **CI mode** (arguments contain `REPO:` and `PR_NUMBER:`): post inline comments and summary to GitHub.
- **Local mode** (all other cases): output the review as text directly. Do NOT post anything to GitHub.

## Steps

1. **Fetch PR details:**

```bash
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json title,body,headRefOid,author,files
gh pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo>
```

2. **Read changed files** to understand the full context around each change (not just the diff hunks).

3. **Analyze the changes** against these criteria:

| Area | What to check |
|------|---------------|
| Error wrapping | Use `fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`, not `%v`; don't swallow errors silently |
| Context propagation | Pass `context.Context` through call chains, respect cancellation |
| Goroutine leaks | Ensure goroutines have exit conditions, use `errgroup` where appropriate |
| Kubernetes operator patterns | RBAC scoping matches actual API calls, reconciler idempotency, status subresource updates, proper use of controller-runtime predicates and event filters |
| Interface compliance | Check that implementations satisfy interfaces at compile time (`var _ Interface = &Struct{}`) |
| CRD changes | Backward compatibility of API types, proper kubebuilder markers, deepcopy generation |
| cert-manager integration | Correct issuer references, certificate rotation handling, mTLS configuration consistency |
| Helm chart changes | Template syntax correctness, value defaults, upgrade path, label selector immutability |
| Kubernetes manifests | Resource limits set, security contexts defined, proper label selectors |
| Dependency pinning | Git-based deps (especially `metalk8s-registry-node-agent`) must pin to a tag, not a branch |
| Testing | New behavior has corresponding Ginkgo tests, test assertions are specific (not just `Expect(err).ToNot(HaveOccurred())` when the value matters too) |
| Security | No credentials or tokens in plain text, RBAC follows least privilege, container security contexts |
| Breaking changes | Anything that changes CRD schemas, public APIs, or Helm chart values |

4. **Deliver your review:**

### If CI mode: post to GitHub

#### Part A: Inline file comments

For each specific issue, post a comment on the exact file and line:

```bash
gh api -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" "repos/<owner/repo>/pulls/<number>/comments" -f body="Your comment<br><br>— Claude Code" -f path="path/to/file" -F line=<line_number> -f side="RIGHT" -f commit_id="<headRefOid>"
```

**The command must stay on a single bash line.** Never use newlines in bash commands — use `<br>` for line breaks in comment bodies. Never put `<br>` inside code blocks or suggestion blocks.

Each inline comment must:
- Be short and direct — say what's wrong, why it's wrong, and how to fix it in 1-3 sentences
- No filler, no complex words, no long explanations
- When the fix is a concrete line change (not architectural), include a GitHub suggestion block so the author can apply it in one click:
  ````
  ```suggestion
  corrected-line-here
  ```
  ````
  Only suggest when you can show the exact replacement. For architectural or design issues, just describe the problem.
  Example with a suggestion block:
  ```bash
  gh api ... -f body=$'Missing the shared-guidelines update command.<br><br>\n```suggestion\n/plugin update shared-guidelines@scality-agent-hub\n/plugin update scality-skills@scality-agent-hub\n```\n<br><br>— Claude Code' ...
  ```
- When the comment contains a suggestion block, use `$'...'` quoting with `\n` for code fence boundaries. Escape single quotes as `\'` (e.g., `don\'t`)
- End with: `— Claude Code`

Use the line number from the **new version** of the file (the line number you'd see after the PR is merged), which corresponds to the `line` parameter in the GitHub API.

#### Part B: Summary comment

```bash
gh pr comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "LGTM<br><br>Review by Claude Code"
```

**The command must stay on a single bash line.** Never use newlines in bash commands — use `<br>` for line breaks in comment bodies.

Do not describe or summarize the PR. For each issue, state the problem on one line, then list one or more suggestions below it:

```
- <issue>
  - <suggestion>
  - <suggestion>
```

If no issues: just say "LGTM". End with: `Review by Claude Code`

### If local mode: output the review as text

Do NOT post anything to GitHub. Instead, output the review directly as text.

For each issue found, output:

```
**<file_path>:<line_number>** — <what's wrong and how to fix it>
```

When the fix is a concrete line change, include a fenced code block showing the suggested replacement.

At the end, output a summary section listing all issues. If no issues: just say "LGTM".

End with: `Review by Claude Code`

## What NOT to do

- Do not comment on markdown formatting preferences
- Do not suggest refactors unrelated to the PR's purpose
- Do not praise code — only flag problems or stay silent
- If no issues are found, post only a summary saying "LGTM"
- Do not flag style issues already covered by golangci-lint (govet, staticcheck, revive, errcheck, gocyclo, dupl, goimports, gofmt, etc.)
